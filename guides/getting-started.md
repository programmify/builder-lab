## Getting Started for PIP4 Interns

Welcome! This toolkit helps you pick tools, learn fast, and ship projects.

### 1) Pick a category and tool
- Start from the README categories or open the `data/` JSON files.
- Choose tools with: Free/Open Source tiers, clear docs, and active community.

### 2) Read the essentials
- Docs: open the `tutorial` link.
- Scan quickstart, auth/setup, and example code.
- Note pricing limits for free tiers.

### 3) Prototype quickly
- Create a small repo: auth + DB + simple UI.
- Use a dev tool (e.g., `Cursor.sh`) and a backend (e.g., `Supabase`).
- Stub the core feature first; avoid premature optimization.

### 4) Learn by doing
- Build one vertical slice end-to-end (UI → API → DB → deploy).
- Use logging and simple analytics to validate usage.

### 5) Ship and iterate
- Deploy with `Vercel`, `Render`, or `Railway`.
- Share on `Product Hunt`, `Peerlist`, and `X`.
- Collect feedback, fix bugs, document setup.

### Checklist
- Tool chosen with sustainable free tier
- Quickstart runs locally
- Deployed URL works
- README includes setup, env vars, and run steps
- Basic analytics added
- Privacy and auth considered

### Tips
- Prefer Open Source or generous free tiers.
- Keep scope tiny; finish a vertical slice in 1–2 days.
- Reuse examples from docs to speed up.
